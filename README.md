An Arduino-based Dual axis Solar Tracker is an intelligent system designed to optimize the efficiency of solar panels. It uses Arduino microcontrollers and various sensors, such as Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) or sun tracking algorithms, to continuously monitor the sun's position. By tracking the sun's movement, it adjusts the orientation of solar panels to keep them facing the sun, ensuring maximum exposure to sunlight throughout the day. It is a smart system designed to improve the performance of solar panels. By utilizing this data, it controls a Servo motor to adjust the solar panel's position, ensuring it continuously faces the sun for maximum energy capture. Unlike fixed solar panels, which remain stationary, dual-axis trackers move solar panels in two directions: azimuth (east-west) and elevation (north-south Dual-axis trackers are equipped with sensors that monitor the sun's position throughout the day. By tracking the sun's movement across the sky, they can precisely adjust the orientation of solar panels to face the sun directly. Dual-axis trackers are particularly effective in regions with significant seasonal variations or at higher latitudes. Dual-axis trackers can increase energy production by up to 45% compared to fixed panels, making them an attractive option for both residential and commercial solar installations
